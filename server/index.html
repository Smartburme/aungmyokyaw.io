      Important:
      In a typical Create React App setup (which your project structure mimics),
      you DO NOT manually include the <script> tag for `src/index.js` here.

      During the build process (`npm run build` or `yarn build`),
      `react-scripts` (Webpack) automatically injects the compiled, optimized,
      and fingerprinted JavaScript bundle (which includes your `src/index.js`
      and all its dependencies) into this `index.html` file.

      Manually adding `<script type="module" src="/src/index.js"></script>` here
      is generally for very basic, unbundled setups, or when using a development
      server like Vite that serves ES modules directly. For CRA, it's automatic.

      So, the <script> tag that references `src/index.js` should be REMOVED
      if it was previously manually added, as CRA handles this injection.

      A placeholder comment explains this below:

      Note: React scripts automatically inject bundled JavaScript files here
      during the build process. Do not add <script> tags for your main JS files manually.
